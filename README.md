 <br />
 usage:

<br />

 #### Create
 Create command is used to create a project in envdost. Where a project is a representation of your current project that contains several number of configuartion files and env or even secret files. You can create a project named todo in a todo project. User must be loggedin to perform this action. This will generate a vault with the provided project name in the authenticated 1password account. You can create multiple projects by separating each name with a space.
 <br />
 usage:
 
 ``` console
â¬¢ projects âš¡ sample â—‰
> envdost create [Project_Name1] [Project_Name2]
```
<br />


 #### Set
 Set command is used to select a project as the current project from all the created project. It is case insensitive but must not differ other than case. You must be logged in to use this command if you are not loggedin then you will be prompted to login first, and then after successful signin this command will run. This will set a selected project in the system env variable.
<br />

> envdost set [Project_Name1]
```
<br />

 #### Push
 Push command parses the provided file and breaks it into key value pair and stores them effeciently in the under the vault i.e vault created with the ` create ` command. You must be loggedin to use this command. 
 <br />
 usage:
 
 ``` console
â¬¢ projects âš¡ sample â—‰
> envdost push [File Name]

<br />


 #### Pull
 Pull command fetches and creates the specified config files. If no file name is supplied it fetches all the files that were pushed under the same project. You must be logged in to use this command. You can use ` -r ` flag to fetch the values in reference mode instead of plain text. It can be useful to ensure the highest level of security. 
 <br />
 usage:
 
 ``` console
â¬¢ projects âš¡ sample â—‰
> envdost pull [File Name]

â¬¢ projects âš¡ sample â—‰

â¬¢ projects âš¡ sample â—‰

 ``` console
â¬¢ projects âš¡ sample â—‰
> envdost delete project [Project name] // deletes all the projects with the given name

â¬¢ projects âš¡ sample â—‰
> envdost delete env [file name] // not available in this version.

```
<br />


### Example:
Here is a simple example of a project using envdost to manage the env files. Let us suppose you have a todo project that has some secrets stored in it's ` .env ` file.

```console
todo-app/
â”œâ”€â”€ config/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ db.config.js
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ .env
â”œâ”€â”€ controllers/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ todoController.js
â”œâ”€â”€ models/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ todoModel.js
â”œâ”€â”€ routes/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ todoRoutes.js
â”œâ”€â”€ app.js
â””â”€â”€ server.js
```
In the above project the ` .env ` file contains sensitive details like database credentials, different client id, and tokens from thirdparty integrations. Here is how you can use ` envdost ` to securely store it.

 ``` bash
â¬¢ projects âš¡ todo â—‰
> envdost create todo
Enter the password for you@gmail.com at my.1password.com:
Logging in â£½
Creating todo project  â¢¿
Project todo created successfully.


â¬¢ projects âš¡ todo â—‰
> envdost set todo
Selecting todo  â£¾
Project todo is selected successfully


â¬¢ projects âš¡ todo â—‰
> envdost push .\config\.env
Processing file .env
Completed processing .env
Uploading .env â£Ÿ
File .env successfully uploaded under project todo


â¬¢ projects âš¡ todo â—‰
> envdost pull
looking for config files in project todo â£»
Fetching content of .env â£¯
File .env created successfully.
Completed writing to file .env
```

It is this simple now the contents of you env file are stored in a your 1password account under the vault todo.
